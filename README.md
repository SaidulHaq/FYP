### University Final Year Project


- ***Project Objective:***

To build an online threat detector by analysing the text of social media.


- ***Project Description:***

The purpose of a scam is to trick people into money problems or to reveal sensitive personal data such as e-mail addresses, passwords, and birth dates-to facilitate the theft of IDs (known as 'phishing'), which could then be used for gain. However, the majority of scams fall into one of three basic categories: 
1. fraud on social media
2. fraud in investments
3. fraud by impostor <br>

Consumers may find it more difficult to make wise judgments or refuse high-pressure sales in vulnerable circumstances, which may raise their risk of fraud. Therefore, this project is capable of handling the issues mentioned above.


- ***Project Platform:***

Python is an identical label corporate data science programming language that has an integrated framework for data planning, machine learning, deep learning, text analysis, and predictive analytics. Besides, it is used for business and commercial applications such as research, education, training, and web development, and supports all machine learning process steps including data preparation, visualization results, model validation, and optimization. Firstly, it would be to download anaconda and PyCharm from the website and setup. Next, set up a python framework flask with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop the front-end part.
