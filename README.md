# FYP - University Final Year Project


#### ***Project Objective:***
To build an online threat detector by analysing the text of social media.


#### ***Project Description:***
The purpose of a scam is to trick people into money problems or to reveal sensitive personal data such as e-mail addresses, passwords, and birth dates-to facilitate the theft of IDs (known as 'phishing'), which could then be used for gain. However, the majority of scams fall into one of three basic categories: 
1. fraud on social media
2. fraud in investments
3. fraud by impostor <br>

Consumers may find it more difficult to make wise judgments or refuse high-pressure sales in vulnerable circumstances, which may raise their risk of fraud. Therefore, this project is capable of handling the issues mentioned above.


#### ***Project Platform:***
Python is implemented in this project to analyze the data since it is an identical label corporate data science programming language with an integrated framework for data planning, machine learning, deep learning, text analysis, and predictive analytics. It also supports all machine learning process steps, including data preparation, display of results, model validation, and optimization, and is utilized for business and commercial applications like research, education, training, and web development. The front-end part was developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The model is finally run using the Python flask framework as the backend.
